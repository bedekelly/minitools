###A basic testing suite for small apps and scripts

This repository contains three subpackages: *test*, *mock* and *patch*. Each of these
can be independently useful, but all can be used together to form a comprehensive (if
basic) testing framework.

###Usage

For some example usage, please see [example.py](example.py): this is an example of how one
might test the code within `test_module`. It uses each of the three subpackages: mock,
patch, and test. Feel free to play around with the code and see what happens when the
test-cases fail etc.
